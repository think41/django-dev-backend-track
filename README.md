## How to Use This Project

1.  **Set Up Your Environment (`prerequisite.md`)**

    Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the [**`prerequisite.md`**](./prerequisite.md) file. This will guide you through installing the necessary software and setting up your local development environment.

2.  **Define Your Use Cases (`use_case.md`)**

    Your first and most important task is to open the [**`use_case.md`**](./use_case.md) file. This is where you will define the actors (users or systems) and the specific use cases (the goals they need to achieve).

    **Do not write any code until you have a clear and comprehensive `use_case.md` file.**

3.  **Specify Your Modules (`spec_template.md`)**

    Once your use cases are defined, you can begin to think about the high-level design of your system. For each major component or module you identify, copy the [**`spec_template.md`**](./spec_template.md) to create a detailed specification for that module.

4.  **Start Development**

    With your prerequisites installed, use cases defined, and module specifications outlined, you are now ready to begin development.
