## 1. Purpose and Responsibility

The `authentication` module is responsible for verifying the identity of users and managing their sessions. It handles user registration, login, logout, and token management to ensure secure access to the system's resources.

### Key Responsibilities:
- User Registration: Allows new users to create an account.
- User Login: Verifies user credentials and issues authentication tokens.
- Session Management: Manages user sessions using tokens (e.g., JWT).
- Token Refresh: Provides a mechanism to refresh expired access tokens.

## 2. Dependencies

- `users` module: For creating and retrieving user data.

## 3. Data Models / Schema

This module does not introduce new data models. It relies on the `User` model from the `users` module for storing user credentials. It is responsible for generating and managing authentication tokens (e.g., JWT), which are issued to the client upon successful authentication.

## 5. Services and Business Logic

- **AuthService:** Handles the core logic for registration, login, and logout. It interacts with the `users` module to manage user data and validates credentials.
- **TokenService:** Responsible for generating, validating, and refreshing JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It will define the token structure, claims, and expiration.
- **PasswordService:** Manages password hashing and verification using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to ensure that passwords are not stored in plaintext.
